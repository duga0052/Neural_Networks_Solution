Neural Networks Solution 

Purpose

This project aims to predict loan eligibility based on various applicant features using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information about applicants' income, loan amount, credit history, and other demographic details. The project involves data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Detailed Steps
1. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named credit.csv using the load_data function from data_preprocessing.py. This function reads the data into a pandas DataFrame and performs initial preprocessing.
2. Data Exploration
Initial Inspection: Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Check for Missing Values: Identify any missing values in the dataset to plan for imputation.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Impute Missing Values: Handle missing values by imputing them with appropriate statistics (mode or median).
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Remove columns that are not needed for the analysis, such as Loan_ID.
Create Features: Convert categorical variables into dummy variables to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
4. Feature Engineering
Separate Features and Target Variable: Split the dataset into input features (x) and the target variable (y), which is Loan_Status.
Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using the split_data function.
5. Data Scaling
Scale the Data: Use Min-Max Scaler to normalize the feature values so that they fall within a specific range, improving the performance of some machine learning algorithms.
6. Model Training
Logistic Regression: Train a logistic regression model using the train_logistic_regression function.
Random Forest: Train a random forest model using the train_random_forest function.
7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate Models: Measure the performance of the models using accuracy scores and confusion matrices on both training and testing sets using the evaluate_model function.
Cross-Validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability using the cross_validate_model function.
8. Model Interpretation
Plot Confusion Matrix: Visualize the confusion matrix for each model using the plot_confusion_matrix function.
9. Data Visualization
Loan Status Distribution: Visualize the distribution of loan statuses using the plot_loan_status_distribution function.
Missing Values Heatmap: Visualize the heatmap of missing values using the plot_missing_values function.
Loan Amount Distribution: Visualize the distribution of loan amounts using the plot_loan_amount_distribution function.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting loan eligibility using machine learning. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The models are evaluated using accuracy scores and confusion matrices to ensure robustness and reliability. The logistic regression and random forest models provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting loan eligibility based on applicant data.
